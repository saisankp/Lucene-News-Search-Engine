# Lucene News Search Engine

This project uses Java 1.8 and Apache Lucene 8.11.2 to index the collection in the `collection` folder which is around 2GB in size (containing news articles from various sources), search the generated index and score different search engines using the queries from [this qrel file](https://github.com/saisankp/Lucene-News-Search-Engine/blob/main/qrels.assignment2.part1). For details on the implementation, read the [report](https://github.com/saisankp/Lucene-News-Search-Engine/blob/main/report/report.pdf).

## Highest MAP value
Highest MAP: **0.3366**

Search engine combination that gave this MAP: **CustomAnalyzer, LMJelinek-Mercer Similarity and QueryParser**

## Run

### Quickest way (just evaluate)
Just evaluate the code (if indexing is already done in `/index`):

```
chmod +x evaluate.sh
./evaluate.sh
```

### Longer way (indexing the collection yourself)
Index the collection yourself first:

```
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

Then evaluate the code afterwards:

```
chmod +x evaluate.sh
./evaluate.sh
```

### Longest way (run each operation individually)
If you want to run the code individually:

```
java -jar target/info-retrieval-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --operation <index|search|evaluate> <analyzer> (similarity) (parser)
```

where entities with <> are required and entities with () are optional depending on the operation you require, since `similarity` and `parser` are required for `evaluate` and `search` but not `index`. The only requirement for `index` is `analyzer`.

* `index` builds the Lucene index using the Indexer class
* `search` allows for interactive search using the Searcher class (this option is only here for curiosity purposes)
* `evaluate` scores against a library of queries from the `topics` folder using the Scorer and Searcher classes. We use trec_eval thereafter to get MAP values from these.

## Setting up trec_eval
We added trec_eval as a git submodule in this codebase. If you are setting up this repository from scratch, run these commands:

```
git submodule update --init
cd trec_eval
make
make quicktest
cd ..
```

### Git issues with trec_eval
If you are setting up the git submodule for trec_eval for the first time, you may get a trec_eval.diff being tracked which won't go away. Simply make a .gitignore inside the trec_eval folder and put the wildcard '*' inside. This is already handled for our virtual machine so demonstrators don't need to follow this.
